Procedural Terrain Generation Methods
=====================================

This project was developed for PCG university course.

All the algorithms are based on [PCG Book](http://pcgbook.com/ "PCG Book").

Implemented algorithms
-------------------------------------

1. Bilinear interpolation
2. Gradient based random terrain

Running the program generates two png files: heightmap_1.png, heightmap_2.png. The first file represents the heightmap created with bilinear interpolation, the second - with gradient interpolation.

To create the actual terrain I used Photoshop to convert **.png** to **.raw** and then put the file into Unity as a terrain heightmap.
